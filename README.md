## Background

The survey was realized within the <a href="https://www.pigweb.eu/">PIGWEB</a> project. The project received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 101004770. The survey was also supported by the <a href="https://www.nfdi4biodiversity.org/en/">NFDI4Biodiversity</a> project (part of the National Research Data infrastructure (<a href="https://www.nfdi.de/">NFDI</a>) and received funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG; Grant Agreement No 442032008). <br>

The survey ran from 2024-09-03 to 2024-09-30 and aimed to explore the potential for adapting an existing metadata standard for biological data to livestock data. Metadata standards are essential to ensure consistent, accurate and accessible data across research studies and to facilitate the sharing and comparison of results. The feedback gathered will help refine and develop a standardized framework for livestock data.
